## 🔬 What this is about

I like to create **explorables**, which are small and interactive simulations that let you *play* with scientific ideas instead of just reading about them.

The goal is simple:  
make abstract concepts more intuitive by letting people see them, tweak them, and feel how they behave.

Most of the projects in this organization exist either to:
- Build interactive physics simulations directly
- Develop **tools and engines** that make creating those simulations easier and faster
- Have fun by creating game engines that help me understand more of the reality and technical challenges of simulating things

## 🧩 Explorables & Tools

A big part of this work is tooling. Over time, I ended up writing my own engines and libraries to support the kind of simulations I want to build.

Some of the main projects you'll find here:

### 🧠 Simulation engines

- **WaterDropEngine (Rust)**  
  A high-performance simulation / rendering engine focused on physics-driven systems that I develop on my free time for fun.

- **PhysicsSimulationEngine (JavaScript)**  
  A lightweight physics and math simulation engine for web-based explorables.

These engines are not meant to be 'general purpose game engines'.  
They are designed specifically to support **interactive scientific simulations**.

## 🧪 Why interactive simulations?

Equations, diagrams, and static plots are useful, but they don't always build intuition.

Explorables let you:
- change parameters and immediately see the result  
- experiment freely instead of following a fixed explanation  
- develop an intuitive understanding of motion, forces, systems, and dynamics  

That's the kind of learning experience I'm interested in building.
